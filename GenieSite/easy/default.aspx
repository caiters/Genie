<!-- Easy Installation -->
<h3>Fast &#38; Easy Installation</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>1.</b> Light weight powerhead design &#8211; Genie's high performing DC motor is significantly lighter than a traditional AC motor &#45; over 50% in some cases! Automobile&#45;inspired high stiffness chassis provides high strength to weight ratio.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>2.</b> Quick rail assembly thanks to easy head&#45;to&#45;rail attachment for belt/chain models &#8211; only 4 screws! For screw drive models &#45; only 6 screws plus a mounting flange &amp; coupling!</p></li>
    <li><p><b>3.</b> Fully assembled, pre&#45;tensioned rails for belt/chain models with quick access to adjustment tension feature if needed.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>4.</b> Low profile C&#45;channel rail is great for low headroom applications.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>5.</b> For attachment of the photo eye &amp; wall console wiring to the powerhead, the unit has easy&#45;connect wire guide leads with no fasteners required thanks to the internal spring clip that quickly grasps the wire end. The area is easily accessed from the light housing.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>6.</b> Auto&#45;set yet adjustable force &amp; speed settings.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>7.</b> Easy steps to cut down the rail on the job site as needed for screw, belt, or chain drive units.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>8.</b> Models 2028/1028 have the smallest footprint of any trolley opener allowing for tight installations.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>9.</b> Direct path for photo eye wiring from header to motor along the top of the rail saves installation time, especially with vaulted ceilings. Clips to secure wiring to rail provided for added convenience.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>10.</b> Integrated photo eye, mounting bracket, and screw terminal connection eliminates the need to splice wires.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>11.</b> Straight door arm is factory&#45;attached to belt and chain rails.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>12.</b> Serial numbers are matched on powerhead, carton, and Operation &amp; Programming manual for quick reference.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>13.</b> Auto&#45;Seek Dual Frequency of 315 or 390 MHz enhances performance &amp; reduces or eliminates potential callbacks due to near&#45;by frequency interference such as military base equipment. Since it is forward and backward compatible with all Genie openers, there is no need to have two different remotes to control two different openers of different years. That means older Genie remotes (non dipswitch) can be programmed to new openers and new remotes can be programmed to older openers.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>21.</b> Rails are shrink&#45;wrapped in easy&#45;to&#45;differentiate colors of red (belt), blue (screw), &amp; black (chain).
