<h2>TESTING &#8211; RELIABILITY &#8211; EVALUATION &#8211; QUALITY</h2>
<p>At the Genie TREQ Center, products are subject to testing under a variety of conditions including extreme temperatures, motor stress tests, and cycle tests to ensure the products meet your expectations, whether you are a homeowner, builder, or remodeler.</p>

<p>The Genie TREQ Center is accredited as a UL Client Test Data Lab. To show its range and depth, the UL Client Test facility allows for 70 UL and CSA sponsored tests. That type of background tells you how serious we are at Genie about quality design and production.</p>
<p>It was at TREQ that the development of our biggest and most aggressive product launch in years took center stage. The TriloG and IntelliG openers, as well as PowerMax, SilentMax, and ChainMax, are the direct result of a multi-year development cycle in which product was designed and tested, and then cycled millions of times without failure. Thatâ€™s quality assurance you can count on.</p>
<p>Temperature and humidity chamber with ranges of -55C (-59F) to 85C (185F); salt spray test chamber; door testing capability up to 20 ft. wide and 10 ft. high; Hysteresis Dynomometer for motor testing up to 1 HP; mechanical component testing racks; and full metrological capability, including a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) and Vision System for color, gloss, and hardness analysis. Genie spared no expense in making sure these openers and their accessories are more than worthy of your purchase.</p>

<p>To make sure there is adequate testing capacity, dozens of residential and commercial operator stations with life cycle and lift test capability are in full operation.</p>
<p>What does all that mean for you?</p>
<p>It means that you can be confident that the Genie opener that opens and closes your door will perform well under a variety of conditions for years to come. Its Limited Lifetime warranty is your assurance, as the warranty covers both the motor and integrated gearbox for IntelliG, SilentMax, and ChainMax, and the motor and drive screw for TriloG and PowerMax.</p>
<p>It means you have the biggest DC motor in the industry at 140V driving your opener.</p>
<p>And finally, it means that all of the openers listed above werenâ€™t just "Assembled in the USA", they were "Designed and Tested in the USA".</p>
