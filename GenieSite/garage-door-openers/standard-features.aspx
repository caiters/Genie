<!-- intellicode -->
<h3 id="intellicode">Intellicode<span class="reg">&reg;</span> Access Security System</h3>
<p>The Intellicode 2 Access Security System provides state-of-the-art security for your home by automatically changing your openerâ€™s access code every time you push the remote control button. This prevents an unauthorized person from stealing the access code to your opener system and gaining entry to your garage.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: Conventional garage door openers are coded to send out the same fixed code time after time. Genieâ€™s superior encryption technology, also known as rolling access codes, uses a proprietary coding system that selects a new code from billions of possible combinations each time the system is activated.</p>

<!-- homelink -->
<h3 id="homelink">HomeLink<span class="reg">&reg;</span></h3>
<p>Both systems incorporate the Genie Intellicode Access Security code into each product. With Intellicode, both systems gain the security of a 4.3 billion combination rolling code and integration with Genie operators.</p>
<p>HomeLink is a factory installed transmitter option found in a growing number of automobiles. The HomeLink transmitter is usually found on an automobile visor and is ready to open and close any Genie garage door opener with Intellicode.  There is no need to purchase additional transmitters.</p>
